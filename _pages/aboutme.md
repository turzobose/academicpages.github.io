I am a first year MPhil student in the Department of Integrative Systems and Design at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, working with Prof. Tristan Braud. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Chemical and Environmental Engineering also from HKUST.

## Research Theme

My primary research is in **Human-Computer Interaction** and I focus on **Object Localisation and Mapping**. I am a Chemical Engineer who fell in love with Artificial Intelligence. My interests lie in solving quantitative problems and modeling complex systems. My research topic is situated at the intersection of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Computational Methods.

## What's Cooking

I write about different algorithms, approaches and differences in frameworks etc in my blog. Projects done on Object Detection and segmentation, model training and tuning with Pytorch and Tensorflow with Visualization can be viewed at the Portfolio tab. I love travelling, exploring new cultures and cuisines. Some of my travel stories will soon be found on the Travels page.
